*As it was my first time manipulating data via tableau, i was experimenting with the interface and its range of visual options*

*Started to mess around with the available options and was able to make a simple dashboard as reference for how i might be able to use tableau to gain insight, compare, or contrast data*

*As this was my second ever project on Tableau i took a few minutes to go over the original dataset(something i would have benefitted from the first time) in order to get a better picture of what the type of categories and records the Dataset will contain when creating my insights*

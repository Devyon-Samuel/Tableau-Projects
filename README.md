*As it was my first time manipulating data via tableau, i was experimenting with the interface and its range of visual options*

*Started to mess around with the available options and was able to make a simple dashboard as reference for how i might be able to use tableau to gain insight, compare, or contrast data*

## Malawi National Football Team Dataset

*As this was my second ever project on Tableau i took a few minutes to go over the original dataset(something i would have benefitted from the first time) in order to get a better picture of what the type of categories and records the Dataset will contain when creating my insights*

*The first insight which i thought would be useful was to start by creating an overview of the national teams all time fixtures to give an early idea of what the basis of the analysis is about to stakeholders. This dashboard shows the exact scores for each individual recorded games, the competition and the exact year*

*With the use of the first dashboard i was able to delve deeper into the dataset to see which insights i could potentially find. I was able to effectively combine the goal lines in the fxture history, which provided me with a better overview of their alltime goal records. This showed the total amount of goals they have conceded in total and in each individual type of fixture, as you can see they conceded the most goals in the AFCON Qualifiers (26) and scored the most goals against opponents also in the AFCON (18). In total they have conceded 113 goals & scored 60, from the data alone i can start to gain insight of the potential lack of team quality over the years, and from the line graph i shows the team has a level of inconsistency*

*To provide further insight i was able to find out whether the games were home or away fixtures, and total the number of wins/losses/draws in each competition*
